							Application for the position of <span id="label3">Computational Engineer</span> 
						</div>

						<p><span id="person"> Dear Concern </span>,</p>

						<p>
							I am writing to express my sincere interest and enthusiasm for the position of <b id="label4">Computational Engineer</b> at <b id="company">XYZ</b>, as advertised on <b id="source">StepStone</b>. I recently completed my Ph.D. in <i>Computational Mechanics</i>, with a dissertation titled "Development of scaled boundary polygon elements for coupled thermoelastic fracture modeling." I am now seeking new professional challenges. Over the past seven years, I worked as a research assistant at the University of Duisburg-Essen, where I developed extensive skills and expertise in areas such as <i><b id="skill1">FEA, CFD</b></i>, and <i><b id="skill2">SBFEM</b></i>, all of which are relevant to this position.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a research assistant, I played a key role in developing an innovative finite element method (Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method, SBFEM) for solving multiphysics (thermo-elastic) fracture problems in specialized engineering materials. I was responsible for the entire process, from mesh generation and element formulation to solver implementation and post-processing. I programmed this numerical method in <i>MATLAB</i> and integrated it into our object-oriented in-house code library. In addition to MATLAB, I have gained expertise in various other tools, such as <i><b id="skill3">Ansys, Gmsh</b></i>, and <i><b id="skill4">ParaView</b></i>, significantly refining my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail.
						</p>
						<p>
							Furthermore, I have participated in international research collaborations, notably contributing to the joint initiatives between the University of Duisburg-Essen and Federation University (Australia). I have also contributed to the academic community through presentations at international conferences and publications in prestigious journals. These aspects of my work have particularly enhanced my communication and teamwork skills.
						</p>
						<p>
							Besides my research activities, I have taught courses such as "Structural Dynamics" and "Computer Languages for Engineers" at the master's level. The former focused on the fundamentals of structural analysis and practical applications using Ansys, while the latter aimed to teach <i>FORTRAN</i>, <i>C++</i>, and <i>Python</i>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Moreover, I supervised several theses in various areas of Computational Mechanics, including Computational Fluid Dynamics (<i>CFD</i>), dynamic load analysis, and polygon meshing techniques. I have also led an e-learning project to digitalize course materials using tools such as <i>JavaScript</i>, <i>HTML</i>, and <i>CSS</i>. These activities have considerably sharpened my project management, organizational, and innovative skills.
						</p>
						<p>
							These extensive experiences have greatly enhanced both my technical expertise and interpersonal skills. I am confident that my background and expertise make me a strong candidate for the position. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my qualifications align with your needs. Thank you for considering my application.
						</p>

						<p>Sincerely,</p>
